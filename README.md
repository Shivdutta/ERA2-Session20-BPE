# BPE Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm, which is a subword segmentation algorithm commonly used in natural language processing tasks. The BPE algorithm is useful for handling out-of-vocabulary words by breaking them into more manageable subword units.


## Notebook Contents
The `BPE.ipynb` notebook includes the following sections:
1. **Data Preparation**: Loading and preparing the dataset for BPE. The data is downloaded from kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/disisbig/hindi-wikipedia-articles-172k
2. **Training BPE**: Training the BPE model on the dataset.
3. **Applying BPE**: Using the trained BPE model to encode new text.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the BPE model.
